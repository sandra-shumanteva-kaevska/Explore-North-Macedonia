        "description": "Our overnight trip to Korab is an experience you will never forget, hiking near the highest peak in the Republic of Macedonia at 2,764m. This journey goes through isolated mountain monasteries, with delicious mountain fruit ripe for tasting, blue berries and strawberries are abundant. This hiking adventure in Macedonia is physically challenging (six hour hike on the first day) so prepare for a workout as we hike upward. The Macedonian mountains are alive so there is always a chance to spot wild animals like deer or bears and chance of hearing wolves howling in the distance. The very rare and elusive Macedonian lynx also lives in these mountains, the lynx is a national symbol of Macedonia and is featured on the 5 denar coin. As we reach our destination we are greeting with a spectacularl view, a landscape of mountain peaks and a magnificent waterfall (korab waterfall). Soaking in the wonderful natural ambient we setup camp underneath the waterfall. Here wood is collected and a fire is started to keep us warm during the night and used to prepare our food for the feast whilst enjoying famous Macedonian Rakija. Our descent the following day is easier, following the mountain rivers down, here there is a chance to see deer in the wild and drink pristine water just melted from the winter snow. Walking down different forests until we finally reach our destination at Popova Sapka. This is a Macedonia hiking trip you will not forget.",
